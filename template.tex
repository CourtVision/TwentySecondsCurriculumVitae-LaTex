%	 ABOUT ME
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


\aboutme{ Maybe one should have a track record in the field of quantitative economic research and simultaneously accept business-challenges in a fast-evolving, data-driven environment to become an enthusiastic data scientist.\\\vspace{5pt}
 As being one, I love to watch the keras progress bars moving fast, getting rid of NAs in corporate-wide data integration projects including Big Data \& Oracle architectures and contributing to cloud-based AI \& ML projects.\\\vspace{5pt}
 I am a fan of coupling practice and research-based approaches in the classroom and in the office. My  more than 500 students and many executives have confirmed time and again that I am capable of making complex quantitative models easy to understand.} % To have no About Me section, just remove all the text and leave \aboutme{}

%\section{Other information}

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
